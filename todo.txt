This file contains some suggestions for improvements that could be tried by anyone playing with the code.

* Include emoji list
Convert strings like %smile% or %cat% to entries from a preset list of emojis.

* Pretty-printing
The default chat.html is pretty unappealing. Nothing a bit of CSS wouldn't fix.

* Autoreconnecting
Make the websocket reconnect automatically if it disconnects.
* Remember name
Screennames could be stored in a cookie and sent automatically when the socket connects.

* Message colouring
Have a default colour with a command to change the foreground and background colour with a command like:
/colour white black
This should set the users text colour to white and background colour to black.

* Support links
This could either be in the form of a command:
/link https://www.facebook.com Facebook
Which would show a link that could be clicked.
Alternatively you could modify the message function in the functions list in chat.js to automatically recognise links and make them into proper anchor tags.

* Add SSL support
Obviously this would secure the chatroom against the prying eyes of anyone not connected to the chatroom.

* Only send messages to users with names
This would mean people could not silently connect and read incoming messages without anyone knowing.

* Support @mentions
This could allow you to send private messages or let users hear a different notificationsound if their name were @mentioned.

* Support hash tags
This could be used to let users ignore specific hash tags.

* Support persistant users
Allow users to login so their name and other information could be stored. This would make things less annoying if the websocket connection gets dropped.

* Multiroom support
Give users the ability to create rooms like on Teamtalk or IRC. As a bonus they should be deleted when they are emptied.

* Different command prefix
Users could be given the opotunity to specify their own command prefix (like space for example) so that commands are easier to type from mobile devices.
